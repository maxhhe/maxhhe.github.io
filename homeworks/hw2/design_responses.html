					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that it is not necessary to place all of the important content of a webpage above the fold. The article stated that users are more used to scrolling past the fold nowadays. This means that important content can be below the fold and users will still end up seeing it. This makes including white space a lot easier because you don't have to try and pack every important piece of content above the fold. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the images that showed the difference between different pages with and without white space. They were a great visual that perfectly showed the difference that white space can make. With white space, the pages looked less cluttered and it felt like there was a clear flow of content.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> A quote from the website that I found interesting was "When in doubt, add more white space" </p>
						</li>
