            <li>I learned that certain heirarchies of objects on a user interface can direct the users attention. This includes design choices like highlights, colors, text fonts, shapes, and sizes of objects. These are all ways that designers tell a story or convey a message to users.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was the GIFs that the author included. They showed different parts of apps slowly being added back to the screen of a phone. This was cool to see because you could really tell how each app was constructed and the thinking behind it. It was interesting to see how the app pages could be broken down into these smaller parts.</li>
            <li>"Someone had to map out all of the content use cases and decide on the appropriate subheaders to pair with them."</li>
            <li>My enjoyment of reading this article was an 8/10. It was really interesting and informative.</li>
