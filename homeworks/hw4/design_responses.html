						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that when designing a webpage, you have to think about accessibility in every aspect of your page. Not only the contrast of your colors can affect the ability of your audience to understand and explore the page. Guiding details and other accessibility features such as focus state scrolling are also critical implementations. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the part that detailed that you don't have to rely on color on its own to highlight important information. The article talked about how there are other features that can help you guide focus and create spotlights on certain pieces of information. The examples they gave were iconography and messaging. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
